# Wifiphisher-Pi-lite
Wifi captive portal, made to auto-run on Rasbian Lite

A simple script to automticly install Wifiphisher and its dependencies on Rasbian Lite and make it run automaticly <br>
 _(tested on rasberry pi 3a)_ <br>
(Note: This will use the interface **wlan1**, so a wifi adapter is needed)
 
<br>

Original Wifiphisher tool can be found at: https://github.com/wifiphisher/wifiphisher

Credit for the tool obviously also goes to @https://github.com/tur11ng

<br>

#### This was made for RaspberryPi OS Lite on the Pi 3 and may not work on other Pi OS versions/distros 

# Installation <br>

1. Paste this command in terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Easty101/wifi-pi-lite.git
```

This might take a while.
